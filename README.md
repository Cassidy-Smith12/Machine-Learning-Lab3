 Exercise 1:
 Given the dataset: recipes_muffins_cupcakes_scones.csv, print the variance ratio and plot the
 cumulative sum of the variance ratio for all 8 features. In addition, using as a reference the plots
 in slides 110-115, create a scatter plot between PC1 and PC2. In addition, create a histogram
 of features and plot a heatmap with the features with the largest variation in PC1 and PC2.
 Furthermore, find and print the features with the highest (max) and lowest (min) variation both
 in PC1 and PC2 (positively and negatively correlated). Finally, plot a correlation heatmap.
